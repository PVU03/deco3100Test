                    <br>
                    In this quarter, the highest average global temperature was in the 5th week where the temperature
                    reached 25.7°C. Following this week, the temperature started to decline reaching the lowest
                    average globalt emperature in week 12 at 24.3°C.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout this quarter, the temperature fluctuated between 24.3°C and 25.7°C, meaning the
                    temperature
                    tends to be relatively stable throughout the quarter. Week 5 may refelct a temporary warming event.

                    <br><br>
                    In this quarter, the global temperature was settled between 24°C and 26°C. With week 5 being the
                    highest recorded temperature, it also recorded the highest predicted mean value at 0.87,
                    meaning
                    employees are predicted to have felt warmer in this week. This means employees may have noticed that
                    their
                    environment has felt warmer.
                    <br><br>
                    Alongsde this, the predicted percentage dissatisfied also reached its highest in week 5,
                    reaching
                    24.7% of employees in the environment feeling dissatisfied with the increase in temperature.
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of the quarter after week 5, the temperature tended decline, with the predicted mean
                    value ranging
                    between 0.5 to 0.65. Predicted percentage dissatisfied also tended to be stay around the 13-18%
                    range.

                    Following week 4, temperatures dropped slightly, with predicted mean values fluctuating
                    near neutral or
                    slightly positive levels, mostly between -0.08 and 0.38. The predicted percentage dissatisfied also
                    generally remained around
                    10–11%, indicating that the majority of occupants experienced moderate comfort for most of the
