                    <br><br>
                    In this quarter, the global temperature was settled between 24°C and 26°C. With week 5 being the
                    highest recorded temperature, it also recorded the highest predicted mean value (PMV) at 0.87,
                    meaning
                    employees are predicted to have felt warmer in this week. This means employees may have noticed that
                    their
                    environment has felt warmer.
                    <br><br>
                    Alongsde this, the predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) also reached its highest in week 5,
                    reaching
                    24.7% of employees in the environment feeling dissatisfied with the increase in temperature.
                    <br><br>
                    For the rest of the quarter after week 5, the temperature tended decline, with the PMV ranging
                    between 0.5 to 0.65. PPD also tended to be stay around the 13-18% range.
